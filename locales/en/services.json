  "servicesText": "In our Adult Daycare Center, we offer different programs that will pleasantly surprise and interest everyone. Don't you agree that not everyone finds 20 minutes to create something special for themselves? Such as listening to a favorite song, learning something new, having a face to face conversation, or even better, taking a short trip/tour somewhere. In Adult Daycare Center \"Kupalinka\" you have an opportunity to do all that. And you will not be alone in it!\nWe would like to address everyone, not just \"Medicaid\" recipients. Our center is open for everyone in town and we are more than happy to provide paid services for people who are interested. You just have to dial our number and we will be more than happy to answer all of your questions.",
