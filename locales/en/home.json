In April of 2017 Adult Day Care Center \"Kupalinka\" opened doors for everyone.\nKupalinka is a fairy tale girl and according to the old legend, she was looking for the flower of green fern, which became a symbol of kindness, symbol of hope, symbol of looking and finding something light, something better.
