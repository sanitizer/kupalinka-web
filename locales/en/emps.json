Giving them a helping hand as well as showing them compassion and support-still a life priority.\nAll that led to the choosing of profession in field which was helping people in the time of need. Metropolitan State  University (formerly known as Metropolitan State College) awarded a degree in 2001 and since that time the main mission is to provide compassion and support for people when they need it.  Personal values, respect, dependability, and support was a main foundation for the Adult Day Care Center \"Kupalinka\". Being a very social person throughout a life is another key for opening the Adult Day Care Center “Kupalinka” with an idea of being a great social center for people.\nAdult Day Care Center “Kupalinka” was created with an idea of providing services with human touch and kind heart. This center is a home away from home for people of all walks of life. We are here to support and help when they need us the most."
